## Why am I doing this?

- Pretty good intro to snakemake
- I am curious if they got it right

## Fancy graph

```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
figure_path = None
```

```{python}
from os.path import join
import altair as alt

figure_path = join("../../", figure_path)
with open(figure_path, "r") as file:
    json_string = file.read()
alt.Chart.from_json(json_string)
```
